Step 0: Transcribe GRB follow-up observations into a .json file. The GRBXXXXXX_json_from_obs.py
scripts can be used as guides for how to format the .json observation files per the OAC schema.

Step 1: Use the `get_obs_sources` function from `utils.py`, supplying the path/to/GRBXXXXXX.json as
as as input, to get the telescope, instrument, and filter information for each observation.

Step 2: Provide the outputs of Step 1) as keys to the fmap dictionary in `get_filters.py`.
The value matched to each key should follow the naming convention of the Spanish Virtual Observatory
(SVO) Filter Profile Service filter IDs.

Step 3: Once all the filters needed for conversion of observations to LSST grizy / 2MASS JHK are
acquired, run the `update_photometry` function from `utils.py` to identify which of the
grizy/JHK filters overlap with the initial observation and calculate the magnitude in those filters.
This function will automatically updated the GRBXXXXXX.json photometry data and produce a new
GRBXXXXXX.json file.
